However, the Big Data issue has perplexed most lattice based cryptographic systems since the overall processing is slowed down too much. This paper intends to analyze one of the major lattice-based cryptographic systems, Nth-degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU), and accelerate its execution with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for acceptable processing speed. Three strategies, including single GPU with zero copy, single GPU with data transfer, and multi-GPU versions are proposed for performance comparison. GPU computing techniques such as stream and zero copy are applied to overlap computations and communications for possible speedup. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GPU acceleration of NTRU. As the number of involved devices increases, better NTRU performance will be achieved. © 2014, Atlantis Press.

Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3.We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H...O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.   \n",
              "2  We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.   \n",

A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.   \n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.   \n",

              "      <td>We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Reversible logic has become very promising for low-power design using emerging computing technologies. A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In this research, a general formula for the Casimir force between ideal metal plate and a dissipative dielectric slab has been obtained. The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.</td>\n",

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Correspondence Address\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8813,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"J.

However, the Big Data issue has perplexed most lattice based cryptographic systems since the overall processing is slowed down too much. This paper intends to analyze one of the major lattice-based cryptographic systems, Nth-degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU), and accelerate its execution with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for acceptable processing speed. Three strategies, including single GPU with zero copy, single GPU with data transfer, and multi-GPU versions are proposed for performance comparison. GPU computing techniques such as stream and zero copy are applied to overlap computations and communications for possible speedup. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GPU acceleration of NTRU. As the number of involved devices increases, better NTRU performance will be achieved. © 2014, Atlantis Press.

Resonant absorption by TLSs in the dielectric poses a serious limitation to the performance of superconducting qubits; however, the microscopic nature of these systems has yet to be established. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3.We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H...O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.  \n",
              "2  We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.  \n",

A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.  \n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.  "

              "      <td>Lattice based cryptography is attractive for its quantum computing resistance and efficient encryption/decryption process. However, the Big Data issue has perplexed most lattice based cryptographic systems since the overall processing is slowed down too much. This paper intends to analyze one of the major lattice-based cryptographic systems, Nth-degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU), and accelerate its execution with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for acceptable processing speed. Three strategies, including single GPU with zero copy, single GPU with data transfer, and multi-GPU versions are proposed for performance comparison. GPU computing techniques such as stream and zero copy are applied to overlap computations and communications for possible speedup. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GPU acceleration of NTRU. As the number of involved devices increases, better NTRU performance will be achieved. © 2014, Atlantis Press.

              "      <td>Dissipative two-level systems (TLS) have been a long-standing problem in glassy solids over the last fifty years, and have recently gained new relevance as sources of decoherence in quantum computing. Resonant absorption by TLSs in the dielectric poses a serious limitation to the performance of superconducting qubits; however, the microscopic nature of these systems has yet to be established. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3.We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H...O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.</td>\n",

              "      <td>We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Reversible logic has become very promising for low-power design using emerging computing technologies. A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.</td>\n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.</td>\n",

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "2  We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.   \n",

A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs.

We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.   \n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.   \n",

It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In this research, a general formula for the Casimir force between ideal metal plate and a dissipative dielectric slab has been obtained. The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.</td>\n",

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PredictedCountry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As the consequences of temporally correlated noise on the performance of quantum algorithms are not well understood, the capability to engineer and inject such noise in quantum systems is paramount. To date, noise injection capabilities have been limited and highly platform specific, requiring low-level access to control hardware. We experimentally validate our method by comparing to a direct hardware-based noise-injection scheme. Using a combination of quantum noise spectroscopy and classical signal analysis, we show that the two approaches agree. These results showcase a highly versatile method for noise injection that can be utilized by theoretical and experimental researchers to verify, evaluate, and improve quantum characterization protocols and quantum algorithms for sensing and computing. \\u00a9 2022 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.\",\n          \"Reticle optimization is a computationally demanding task in optical microlithography for advanced semiconductor fabrication. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of D-Wave's quantum annealing (QA) and hybrid steepest descent (SD) solvers in solving pixelated binary reticle optimization problems. We show that the energy derived from the objective function depends on annealing time and inter-sample correlation. Specifically, longer annealing times and reduced inter-sample correlations result in lower energy. Moreover, introducing efficient pausing strategies in forward annealing could reduce the QA runtime by approximately 100-fold while achieving similar results to long annealing times. Finally, reticles with increased variables lead to widespread irregular values in default sorted QA energies due to quantum chain breakages, which could potentially limit the probability of attaining the optimal solution. A hybrid approach that applies the classical SD algorithm to the QA results increases the probability of locating the global minimum solution and reduces runtime to about one-third compared to the classical SD solver. These findings facilitate our comprehension of quantum computing for accelerating computational lithography in semiconductor manufacturing.  \\u00a9 2013 IEEE.\",\n          \"A major challenge in developing topological superconductors for implementing topological quantum computing is their characterization and control. It has been proposed that a p-wave-gapped topological superconductor can be fabricated with single-atom precision by assembling chains of magnetic atoms on s-wave superconductors with spin\\u2013orbit coupling. Here we analyse Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference in Mn chains, constructed atom by atom on Nb(110), and reveal the formation of multi-orbital Shiba bands using momentum-resolved measurements. We find evidence that one band features a topologically non-trivial p-wave gap, as inferred from its shape and particle\\u2013hole asymmetric intensity. Our work is an important step towards a distinct experimental determination of topological phases in multi-orbital systems by bulk electron band structure properties only. \\u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1584,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['United States', 'Germany', 'Italy']\",\n          \"['Japan', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom']\",\n          \"['Italy', 'Estonia']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We provide a rigorous analysis of IQAE and prove that it achieves a quadratic speedup up to a double-logarithmic factor compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we show with an empirical study that our algorithm outperforms other known QAE variants without QPE, some even by orders of magnitude, i.e., our algorithm requires significantly fewer samples to achieve the same estimation accuracy and confidence level.\",\n          \"A naive classical representation of an n-qubit state requires specifying exponentially many amplitudes in the computational basis. Past works have demonstrated that classical neural networks can succinctly express these amplitudes for many physically relevant states, leading to computationally powerful representations known as neural quantum states. What underpins the efficacy of such representations? We show that conditional correlations present in the measurement distribution of quantum states control the performance of their neural representations. Such conditional correlations are basis dependent, arise due to measurement-induced entanglement, and reveal features not accessible through conventional few-body correlations often examined in studies of phases of matter. By combining theoretical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate how the state's entanglement and sign structure, along with the choice of measurement basis, give rise to distinct patterns of short- or long-range conditional correlations. Our findings provide a rigorous framework for exploring the expressive power of neural quantum states.\",\n          \"This paper compares quantum computing simulators running on a single CPU or GPU-based HPC node using the Quantum Volume benchmark commonly proposed for comparing NISQ systems.

With increasing numbers of trapped ion groups worldwide, a myriad of trap architectures are currently in use. Applications of trapped ions include: quantum simulation, computing and networking, time standards and fundamental studies in quantum dynamics. Design of such traps is driven by these various research aims, but some universally desirable properties have lead to the development of ion trap foundries. Additionally, the excellent control achievable with trapped ions and the ability to do photonic readout has allowed progress on quantum networking using entanglement between remotely situated ion-based nodes. Here, we present a selection of trap architectures currently in use by the community and present their most salient characteristics, identifying features particularly suited for quantum networking. We also discuss our own in-house research efforts aimed at long-distance trapped ion networking. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (Outside the USA).   \n",
              "1  The world around us may be viewed as a network of entities interconnected via their social, economic, and political interactions. These entities and their interactions form a social network. A social network is often modeled as a graph whose nodes represent entities, and edges represent interactions between these entities. These networks are characterized by the collective latent behavior that does not follow trivially from the behaviors of the individual entities in the network. One such behavior is the existence of hierarchy in the network structure, the sub-networks being popularly known as communities. Discovery of the community structure in a social network is a key problem in social network analysis as it refines our understanding of the social fabric. Not surprisingly, the problem of detecting communities in social networks has received substantial attention from the researchers. In this paper, we propose parallel implementations of recently proposed community detection algorithms that employ variants of the well-known quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA). Like any other evolutionary algorithm, a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is also characterized by the representation of the individual, the evaluation function, and the population dynamics. However, individual bits called qubits, are in a superposition of states. As chromosomes evolve individually, the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) are intrinsically suitable for parallelization. In recent years, programmable graphics processing units — GPUs, have evolved into massively parallel environments with tremendous computational power. NVIDIA® compute unified device architecture (CUDA®) technology, one of the leading general-purpose parallel computing architectures with hundreds of cores, can concurrently run thousands of computing threads. The paper proposes novel parallel implementations of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms in the field of community detection on CUDA-enabled GPUs. The proposed implementations employ a single-population fine-grained approach that is suited for massively parallel computations. In the proposed approach, each element of a chromosome is assigned to a separate thread. It is observed that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than the benchmark algorithms. Further, the proposed parallel implementations achieve significant speedup over the serial versions. Due to the highly parallel nature of the proposed algorithms, an increase in the number of multiprocessors and GPU devices may lead to a further speedup. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.   \n",

In this paper, the problem is considered via computing the maximal quantum value of Svetlichny operators for three-qubit systems and a tight upper bound is obtained. The constraints on the quantum states for the tightness of the bound are also presented. The approach enables us to give the necessary and sufficient conditions of violating the Svetlichny inequality (SI) for several quantum states, including the white and color noised Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. The relation between the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the maximal quantum value of the Svetlichny operators for mixed GHZ class states is also discussed. As the SI is useful for the investigation of GMNL, our results give an effective and operational method to detect the GMNL for three-qubit mixed states. © 2017 American Physical Society.   \n",

The main purpose of the CloudGanga is to integrate all the geospatial information such as dam location, well location, irrigation project, hydro power project, canal network and central Water Commission gauge stations locations related to River Ganga. CloudGanga can help the decision maker/ planner or common users to get enough information for their further research and studies. The open source software (Quantum GIS) has been used for the development of geospatial database. QGIS Plugin has been linked with Quantum GIS for invoking cloud computing environment. It has also discussed about the various overlay analysis in CloudGanga environment. In the present research, machine learning approaches are also used in a R tool for well locations which are associated with the basin of River Ganga.   \n",

              "      <td>Trapped ion technology has seen advances in performance, robustness and versatility over the last decade. With increasing numbers of trapped ion groups worldwide, a myriad of trap architectures are currently in use. Applications of trapped ions include: quantum simulation, computing and networking, time standards and fundamental studies in quantum dynamics. Design of such traps is driven by these various research aims, but some universally desirable properties have lead to the development of ion trap foundries. Additionally, the excellent control achievable with trapped ions and the ability to do photonic readout has allowed progress on quantum networking using entanglement between remotely situated ion-based nodes. Here, we present a selection of trap architectures currently in use by the community and present their most salient characteristics, identifying features particularly suited for quantum networking. We also discuss our own in-house research efforts aimed at long-distance trapped ion networking. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (Outside the USA).</td>\n",

              "      <td>The world around us may be viewed as a network of entities interconnected via their social, economic, and political interactions. These entities and their interactions form a social network. A social network is often modeled as a graph whose nodes represent entities, and edges represent interactions between these entities. These networks are characterized by the collective latent behavior that does not follow trivially from the behaviors of the individual entities in the network. One such behavior is the existence of hierarchy in the network structure, the sub-networks being popularly known as communities. Discovery of the community structure in a social network is a key problem in social network analysis as it refines our understanding of the social fabric. Not surprisingly, the problem of detecting communities in social networks has received substantial attention from the researchers. In this paper, we propose parallel implementations of recently proposed community detection algorithms that employ variants of the well-known quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA). Like any other evolutionary algorithm, a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is also characterized by the representation of the individual, the evaluation function, and the population dynamics. However, individual bits called qubits, are in a superposition of states. As chromosomes evolve individually, the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) are intrinsically suitable for parallelization. In recent years, programmable graphics processing units — GPUs, have evolved into massively parallel environments with tremendous computational power. NVIDIA® compute unified device architecture (CUDA®) technology, one of the leading general-purpose parallel computing architectures with hundreds of cores, can concurrently run thousands of computing threads. The paper proposes novel parallel implementations of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms in the field of community detection on CUDA-enabled GPUs. The proposed implementations employ a single-population fine-grained approach that is suited for massively parallel computations. In the proposed approach, each element of a chromosome is assigned to a separate thread. It is observed that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than the benchmark algorithms. Further, the proposed parallel implementations achieve significant speedup over the serial versions. Due to the highly parallel nature of the proposed algorithms, an increase in the number of multiprocessors and GPU devices may lead to a further speedup. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

              "      <td>It is a challenging task to detect genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL). In this paper, the problem is considered via computing the maximal quantum value of Svetlichny operators for three-qubit systems and a tight upper bound is obtained. The constraints on the quantum states for the tightness of the bound are also presented. The approach enables us to give the necessary and sufficient conditions of violating the Svetlichny inequality (SI) for several quantum states, including the white and color noised Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. The relation between the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the maximal quantum value of the Svetlichny operators for mixed GHZ class states is also discussed. As the SI is useful for the investigation of GMNL, our results give an effective and operational method to detect the GMNL for three-qubit mixed states. © 2017 American Physical Society.</td>\n",

The main purpose of the CloudGanga is to integrate all the geospatial information such as dam location, well location, irrigation project, hydro power project, canal network and central Water Commission gauge stations locations related to River Ganga. CloudGanga can help the decision maker/ planner or common users to get enough information for their further research and studies. The open source software (Quantum GIS) has been used for the development of geospatial database. QGIS Plugin has been linked with Quantum GIS for invoking cloud computing environment. It has also discussed about the various overlay analysis in CloudGanga environment. In the present research, machine learning approaches are also used in a R tool for well locations which are associated with the basin of River Ganga.</td>\n",

We first propose an approach for analyzing a classical communication channel as a quantum channel, and develop an extension of the QEC conditions to the classical case. We derive a quantum analogue of the noncoherent multiantenna wireless channel. Restricting to the case in which the number of transmitter and receiver antennas are equal and a power of two, we use the framework to develop a family of space-Time block codes for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication. Under a Rayleigh fading assumption, we derive the optimal decoder and bound the probability of symbol detection error. We compare our performance to comparable coherent and noncoherent approaches and achieve competitive performance for various antenna geometries and rates. \\u00a9 2020 IEEE.\",\n          \"Quantum machine learning is a promising application of quantum computing for data classification. However, most of the previous research focused on binary classification, and there are few studies on multi\\u2010classification. The major challenge comes from the limitations of near\\u2010term quantum devices on the number of qubits and the size of quantum circuits. In this paper, we pro-pose a hybrid quantum neural network to implement multi\\u2010classification of a real\\u2010world dataset. We use an average pooling downsampling strategy to reduce the dimensionality of samples, and we design a ladder\\u2010like parameterized quantum circuit to disentangle the input states. Besides this, we adopt an all\\u2010qubit multi\\u2010observable measurement strategy to capture sufficient hidden information from the quantum system. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the classical neural network and performs especially well on different multi\\u2010class datasets, which provides some enlightenment for the application of quantum computing to real\\u2010world data on near-term quantum processors. \\u00a9 2022 by the authors.

The Quantum Weighted Minimal Gated Unit (QWMGU) neural network by introducing a quantum computing mechanism into MGU network is presented to predict the effluent total nitrogen. Firstly, a multi-dimensional single-step time series prediction method was used to construct the TN dataset of wastewater; Then, the above index set was input into QWMGU to complete the TN prediction; Lastly, some comparison experiments with the water outlet data of the actual sewage treatment plant were performed. The results show that the proposed TN prediction model based on QWMGU has higher prediction accuracy than QWGRU/MGU/GRU/LSTM, and faster convergence speed than QWGRU/GRU/LSTM. \\u00a9 2022 SPIE.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author_list\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

With increasing numbers of trapped ion groups worldwide, a myriad of trap architectures are currently in use. Applications of trapped ions include: quantum simulation, computing and networking, time standards and fundamental studies in quantum dynamics. Design of such traps is driven by these various research aims, but some universally desirable properties have lead to the development of ion trap foundries. Additionally, the excellent control achievable with trapped ions and the ability to do photonic readout has allowed progress on quantum networking using entanglement between remotely situated ion-based nodes. Here, we present a selection of trap architectures currently in use by the community and present their most salient characteristics, identifying features particularly suited for quantum networking. We also discuss our own in-house research efforts aimed at long-distance trapped ion networking. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (Outside the USA)   \n",
              "1  The world around us may be viewed as a network of entities interconnected via their social, economic, and political interactions. These entities and their interactions form a social network. A social network is often modeled as a graph whose nodes represent entities, and edges represent interactions between these entities. These networks are characterized by the collective latent behavior that does not follow trivially from the behaviors of the individual entities in the network. One such behavior is the existence of hierarchy in the network structure, the sub-networks being popularly known as communities. Discovery of the community structure in a social network is a key problem in social network analysis as it refines our understanding of the social fabric. Not surprisingly, the problem of detecting communities in social networks has received substantial attention from the researchers. In this paper, we propose parallel implementations of recently proposed community detection algorithms that employ variants of the well-known quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA). Like any other evolutionary algorithm, a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is also characterized by the representation of the individual, the evaluation function, and the population dynamics. However, individual bits called qubits, are in a superposition of states. As chromosomes evolve individually, the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) are intrinsically suitable for parallelization. In recent years, programmable graphics processing units — GPUs, have evolved into massively parallel environments with tremendous computational power. NVIDIA® compute unified device architecture (CUDA®) technology, one of the leading general-purpose parallel computing architectures with hundreds of cores, can concurrently run thousands of computing threads. The paper proposes novel parallel implementations of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms in the field of community detection on CUDA-enabled GPUs. The proposed implementations employ a single-population fine-grained approach that is suited for massively parallel computations. In the proposed approach, each element of a chromosome is assigned to a separate thread. It is observed that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than the benchmark algorithms. Further, the proposed parallel implementations achieve significant speedup over the serial versions. Due to the highly parallel nature of the proposed algorithms, an increase in the number of multiprocessors and GPU devices may lead to a further speedup. © 2017 Elsevier B.V   \n",

In this paper, the problem is considered via computing the maximal quantum value of Svetlichny operators for three-qubit systems and a tight upper bound is obtained. The constraints on the quantum states for the tightness of the bound are also presented. The approach enables us to give the necessary and sufficient conditions of violating the Svetlichny inequality (SI) for several quantum states, including the white and color noised Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. The relation between the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the maximal quantum value of the Svetlichny operators for mixed GHZ class states is also discussed. As the SI is useful for the investigation of GMNL, our results give an effective and operational method to detect the GMNL for three-qubit mixed states. © 2017 American Physical Society   \n",

The main purpose of the CloudGanga is to integrate all the geospatial information such as dam location, well location, irrigation project, hydro power project, canal network and central Water Commission gauge stations locations related to River Ganga. CloudGanga can help the decision maker/ planner or common users to get enough information for their further research and studies. The open source software (Quantum GIS) has been used for the development of geospatial database. QGIS Plugin has been linked with Quantum GIS for invoking cloud computing environment. It has also discussed about the various overlay analysis in CloudGanga environment. In the present research, machine learning approaches are also used in a R tool for well locations which are associated with the basin of River Ganga   \n",

              "      <td>Trapped ion technology has seen advances in performance, robustness and versatility over the last decade. With increasing numbers of trapped ion groups worldwide, a myriad of trap architectures are currently in use. Applications of trapped ions include: quantum simulation, computing and networking, time standards and fundamental studies in quantum dynamics. Design of such traps is driven by these various research aims, but some universally desirable properties have lead to the development of ion trap foundries. Additionally, the excellent control achievable with trapped ions and the ability to do photonic readout has allowed progress on quantum networking using entanglement between remotely situated ion-based nodes. Here, we present a selection of trap architectures currently in use by the community and present their most salient characteristics, identifying features particularly suited for quantum networking. We also discuss our own in-house research efforts aimed at long-distance trapped ion networking. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (Outside the USA)</td>\n",

              "      <td>The world around us may be viewed as a network of entities interconnected via their social, economic, and political interactions. These entities and their interactions form a social network. A social network is often modeled as a graph whose nodes represent entities, and edges represent interactions between these entities. These networks are characterized by the collective latent behavior that does not follow trivially from the behaviors of the individual entities in the network. One such behavior is the existence of hierarchy in the network structure, the sub-networks being popularly known as communities. Discovery of the community structure in a social network is a key problem in social network analysis as it refines our understanding of the social fabric. Not surprisingly, the problem of detecting communities in social networks has received substantial attention from the researchers. In this paper, we propose parallel implementations of recently proposed community detection algorithms that employ variants of the well-known quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA). Like any other evolutionary algorithm, a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is also characterized by the representation of the individual, the evaluation function, and the population dynamics. However, individual bits called qubits, are in a superposition of states. As chromosomes evolve individually, the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) are intrinsically suitable for parallelization. In recent years, programmable graphics processing units — GPUs, have evolved into massively parallel environments with tremendous computational power. NVIDIA® compute unified device architecture (CUDA®) technology, one of the leading general-purpose parallel computing architectures with hundreds of cores, can concurrently run thousands of computing threads. The paper proposes novel parallel implementations of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms in the field of community detection on CUDA-enabled GPUs. The proposed implementations employ a single-population fine-grained approach that is suited for massively parallel computations. In the proposed approach, each element of a chromosome is assigned to a separate thread. It is observed that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than the benchmark algorithms. Further, the proposed parallel implementations achieve significant speedup over the serial versions. Due to the highly parallel nature of the proposed algorithms, an increase in the number of multiprocessors and GPU devices may lead to a further speedup. © 2017 Elsevier B.V</td>\n",

              "      <td>It is a challenging task to detect genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL). In this paper, the problem is considered via computing the maximal quantum value of Svetlichny operators for three-qubit systems and a tight upper bound is obtained. The constraints on the quantum states for the tightness of the bound are also presented. The approach enables us to give the necessary and sufficient conditions of violating the Svetlichny inequality (SI) for several quantum states, including the white and color noised Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. The relation between the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the maximal quantum value of the Svetlichny operators for mixed GHZ class states is also discussed. As the SI is useful for the investigation of GMNL, our results give an effective and operational method to detect the GMNL for three-qubit mixed states. © 2017 American Physical Society</td>\n",

The main purpose of the CloudGanga is to integrate all the geospatial information such as dam location, well location, irrigation project, hydro power project, canal network and central Water Commission gauge stations locations related to River Ganga. CloudGanga can help the decision maker/ planner or common users to get enough information for their further research and studies. The open source software (Quantum GIS) has been used for the development of geospatial database. QGIS Plugin has been linked with Quantum GIS for invoking cloud computing environment. It has also discussed about the various overlay analysis in CloudGanga environment. In the present research, machine learning approaches are also used in a R tool for well locations which are associated with the basin of River Ganga</td>\n",

In order to overcome these limitations and increase the level and accuracy of machine intelligence, machine conditions need to be monitored more meticulously. A novel method for the condition monitoring of a 3D-printer is proposed in this paper. Quantum support vector machine (QSVM) is compiled for recognizing the health condition of the 3D-printer. The proposed quantum machine learning approach helps in monitoring the health state of the machine and classifies the same as healthy or aberrant. Classical machine learning approaches are inefficient to process the large amount of experimental data in real time. For better decision-making on such big data, quantum machine learning approaches are deployed which are much more efficient due to their exponential speed and parallel operation on complex sensor data, they show speedups in both the dimensionality and number of experimental data deployed to train the algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy in fault diagnosis than the traditional Support Vector Machine. All the numerical simulations and experiments have been carried out on a real quantum hardware provided by the IBM Quantum computing over the cloud. \\u00a9 2021 The Authors. IET Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Institution of Engineering and Technology\",\n          \"Analytical corrections were developed to improve the accuracy of the PM6 and GFN2-xTB semiempirical quantum mechanical methods for the evaluation of noncovalent interaction energies in alkanes and alkenes. We followed the approach of functional group corrections, wherein the atom-atom pair corrections depend on the nature of the interacting functional groups. The training set includes 21 alkane and 13 alkene complexes taken from the Donchev et al.'s database [Sci. Data 8, 55 (2021)], with interaction energies calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level, and our own data obtained for medium-size complexes (of 100 and 112 atoms). In general, for the systems included in the training and validation sets, the errors obtained with the PM6-FGC and xTB-FGC methods are within the chemical accuracy. \\u00a9 2023 Author(s)\",\n          \"A prominent feature in iron-based superconductors is the strong interplay between superconductivity, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling, which are key ingredients to promote topological states for fault-tolerant quantum computing, including Majorana zero modes (MZMs). While MZMs have been reported recently in FeTe0.55Se0.45, the topological features, magnetism, and superconductivity are found not uniformly across samples. Here, we discuss transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to characterize the electronic states in a series of (Fe, Ni)Te0.55Se0.45, Substituting Ni on the Fe site modifies spin-orbit coupling. We found Ni substitution lowers the superconducting transition temperature and changes the electronic structure and related topological properties. Our investigations suggest the presence of superconductivity and other competing ground states in (Fe, Ni)Te0.55Se0.45 Thus, the ground state control appears to be a prerequisite for the use of MZMs in quantum applications. \\u00a9 2024 IEEE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author_list\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
